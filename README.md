# ecommerce-store
This holds both the front and backend code for the sample ecommerce store. There is another repository ecommerce-frontend-only that we created so we can host the frontend on netlify. 

The backend is running on heroku. Due to the fact heroku is free we must wait for servers to wake up so the initial start of app will take longer. However, once it is up the server runs properly until the site is inactive for longer than 30 minutes. The backend could run all of the time despite having inactivity if we wanted to pay for it, but doesn't seem necessary as this is just a project to show MERN stack skills and capabilities.
